Two last-minute cleanups: the ending graphic hook was being called every frame during all the opening/interstitial screens, so I enhanced the hook so that it's only called during the ending screen loading period a single time. I also greatly simplified the large block of code that was needed to move the field technique menu cursor one pixel to the left (eg when you go to cast a spell on the battlefield) ... goal here was to avoid any kind of unintentional slowdown caused by the old hooks.

The former one should be fine, but the latter one is a tiiiiiny bit risky to make this change so late, but not very.
