This patch revamps the status icon displays for all three systems (menus, fields, combat). Enemies can now show the bingo (sword) icon, though I don't know if they can even be given the ability or not. You can now see field enemy status icons and the boss indicator at the same time. Combat icon displays are now in the same order as menu and field displays, and they've all been reordered more sensibly now. I fixed a bug when going into a tech menu with a 0MP spell (eg Manyo Devil Dance), and some other minor issues as well.

Oh yeah, and the field tiles used are now exclusively in the valid tile range. I believe using the tiles before the 2bpp font I was using were safe, but they were right between two graphical effect tile boundaries, so it's just safer not to use it since we don't have to anymore.
