RC2 adds a workaround for a bug in the PPU2A. It is only necessary to update if you are playing on real hardware with a rare 2/1/2 SNES. The patch also includes three script typo fixes, a correction for the Leviathan technique description, and a correction for Zonbeld's name in chapter 4. It is safe to update your patch while continuing to use your existing save file, if you like.
